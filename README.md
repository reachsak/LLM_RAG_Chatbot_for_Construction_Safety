## Project Overview

This project involves creating a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) chatbot utilizing a large language model (LLM) to provide real-time safety information and guidance on construction sites. The chatbot aims to enhance worker understanding of safety protocols and increase awareness of construction site hazards.

### Key Features

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** Combines retrieval-based methods with generative responses to provide accurate and contextually relevant safety information.
- **Real-Time Safety Guidance:** Offers instant assistance and guidance on safety protocols to workers on construction sites.
- **Enhanced Understanding:** Aims to improve workers' awareness and compliance with safety regulations through interactive and dynamic responses.
