# LLM-Based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Chatbot for Construction Safety

## Project Descrition

Developed a RAG chatbot using LLaMA 3, LlamaIndex, and a vector database to provide construction personnel with instant access to safety protocols and building codes. The AI-powered chatbot offer accurate and contextually relevant information from a construction safety standards database. This system enhances safety awareness and promotes a safer construction environment through efficient knowledge retrieval.
